# Sophomore-Year-Projects
These assignments and programming projects were given to students that utilizes Data Structures, Data Science, Programming Abstractions and the Fundamentals of Software Development.

### Movie Release Analysis 
 - This assignment was a group assignment to utilize Python and its libraries to predict and display revenue using a large amount of data. RMSE (Root Means Squared Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) were created to determine the accuracy of results. The original repository of this program can be viewed under my respositories in repository named "CSE351_Project-Movie-Release-Analysis-"

### Polynomial Calculator
 - This assignment uses Object Oriented Programming, maps, and interfaces in Java to manipute equations and use assertions API to evaluate results. Equation manipulation required for the assignment were addition, subtraction and multiplication. Division of equations was done with spare time.

### Restaurants Simulator
 - This program creates a restaurant simulation using the queues data structure to have customers arrive, leave, and order from a menu. Other factors such as chefs can impact simulations by decreasing time it takes for the food to cook. 

### Todo List Site
 - This assignment was a full stack development project that utilizes MERN and MongoDB allowing users to manage and operate their personal accounts in the use of making lists.
